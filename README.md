Features :
  1. Providing doctors to to follow-up with number of users after having direct access on their reports and history 
  2. We will target the doctors, hospitals, Health centers and units to provide high service to the patients and the device will be enough if there weren't enough labs or equipments yo make periodic blood analysis for patients or it can be used to follow-up with the patient by check their reports and their vital signs. 
  3. Different design for the device, chip shaped that will be connected all the yime by the patient's arm to make periodic blood analysis and if the rate of glucose or blood pressure get higher or lower rapidly the device will alarm the patient and their relative after not answering the alarm for 1 minute, the application will connect directly to the first aid center and send all patient's data like address, relative number, the period of not responding and so on. 

The Analysis:

From predecessor to successor, basing on the old reaserches and the ancient devices, connecting all the previous experiences with the technology to make it easier and more affordable, This is what we made, to ensure that the device meets our design requirements which are: low cost, high efficiency, accurate results, affordable to use by all people from different cultures by simple and Fascinating interface with maintenable equipments. 
 The normal ways to know the expected diseases that you have or may have or get in the future depending on the blood needing you to make a blood analysis then go to the doctor to simplify the meaning of results and the whole blood analysis yo you and tell you how you health is, without ability to predict the future diseases and some doctors don't awareness about the small percentage away from the normal range but this can be dangerous because the small defect from the normal range can be an evidence on a disease in its early stage. Inability of predicting the disease by the doctor can be make the disease develop and be difficult to treat after discovering it in a late stage.  It is known that people can make mistakes, but electronic devices do not, so we decided to build a device that take an amount of blood from you and in opposite it tell you what is the diseases you have or may have in the future. Our steps is that: 
      1: pen shape device with Its operculum is similar to the syringes used to take a blood sample from the user 
      2: this sample pass one an analyzing device that contains a lot of sensors to test your blood, then  produces the percentage of what your blood have from the main components in the blood like: white blood cells, red blood cells, oxygen, hemoglobin, plasma... ect. 
      3: then compare this analyzation with the normal percentage that we entered before in the programe.
      4: the result from the comparing is that show us what is the possible diseases you may have(based on the data base that we entered as every component has a normal percentage that If decreased or increased will make a problem so we make IF loops of the possible thing if your percentage is lower or higher that the normal and the result is the diseases that you already have and this by an equation that we entered in the program for each main component and bases on it you will see if you already have or you have a small percentage on your blood from disease .for example : After comparing the results show that your blood not have the normal percentage of sugar so you now not infected with sugar but if you continue on your way in life you may have it so we transfer to the step number 5 )
      5: After the result appear this result will be stored in the memory on the app that we designed, which will help you from the beginning of knowing your results until the stage of treatment is completed.
      6: After entering the code you have to the app you will begin the period of Prevention or treatment. 
      The website will help you by many features like:
         A) It will show you the Suggested treatments based on your injury rate 
         B) It will monitor your condition daily and remind you of the remedy for the medicine, meaning that it will be an integrated program in each repeat. You must take the medicine. It will remind you of that
         C) It shows you some other things that help you improve quickly, such as some drinks or sports  Based on the disease that appeared to you, adding that it will follow up with you all the results of diseases, not just one disease.  
         D) upon recovery, it will be your assistant so that the disease does not return to you again, every period you will visit the program and do an analysis again, if you improve, it will follow with you.  To get better well. So overall this solution can be with you from the first to the end

Future features:
  1. Providing doctors to to follow-up with number of users after having direct access on their reports and history 
  2. We will target the doctors, hospitals, Health centers and units to provide high service to the patients and the device will be enough if there weren't enough labs or equipments yo make periodic blood analysis for patients or it can be used to follow-up with the patient by check their reports and their vital signs. 
  3.  Different design for the device, chip shaped that will be connected all the yime by the patient's arm to make periodic blood analysis and if the rate of glucose or blood pressure get higher or lower rapidly the device will alarm the patient and their relative after not answering the alarm for 1 minute, the application will connect directly to the first aid center and send all patient's data like address, relative number, the period of not responding and so on.
